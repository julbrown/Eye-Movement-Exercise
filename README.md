# Eye-Movement-Exercise
Description: This repository makes a webpage where eyes follow the movement of the user's mouse across the page. This is done using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Run: Go to this [link](https://julbrown.github.io/Eye-Movement-Exercise/) or download the files and open the index.html in your browser of choice. Make sure all files are in the same folder.

Future improvements: I plan to make the eyes blink occasionaly, return to center if your mouse leaves the window, and have it show displeasure at being clicked.
